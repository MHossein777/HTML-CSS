            <p id="p1"> Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II - American fifth-generation single-seat, single-engine
                multi-role
                fighter built by
                Lockheed Martin as part of the Joint Strike Fighter project , which was aimed at building a machine that
                would meet the
                requirements of all types of American armed forces . The prototype version of the aircraft was known as
                the X-35 JSF,
                but on July 7, 2006, the machine was officially renamed Lightning II . The F-35 Lightning II is capable
                of close support
                missions, bombing and fighter air combat missions. The aircraft project is jointly financed by the
                governments of the
                United States, Great Britain and other countries interested in purchasing the aircraft. The F-35
                Lightning II was built
                under the direction of Lockheed Martin in collaboration with BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman .

                The JSF program was initiated to build a machine capable of replacing many types of aircraft, which is
                expected to
                reduce the costs of their production and maintenance. Ultimately, three versions of the F-35 are to be
                created, in which
                80% of the structural elements will be identical, and the remaining 20% ​​will be dedicated systems,
                adapting the
                machine to perform specific tasks or activities in specific conditions.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Genesis
                <span>Advanced Strike Technology</span>
                With the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, US military spending was reduced. After the collapse of
                the
                Soviet
                Union , savings began to be sought, and many arms programs were canceled or reduced. Launched in 1991,
                the
                Multi Role
                Fighter (MRF) program to build the successor to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft used
                by
                the United
                States Air Force ended in 1993. A similar fate befell the AX programs, which was to emerge a joint
                attack
                aircraft for
                the Air Force and the United States Navy - the future successor of the Grumman A-6 Intruder machines ,
                General Dynamics
                F-111 ,McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle and Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk - and A / FX, which was also
                aimed
                at selecting
                a multipurpose fighter aircraft for the US Air Force and the Navy. The tendency for new constructions to
                meet the
                requirements of all three types of armed forces having their own air fleets (navy, US Air Force and
                United
                States Marine
                Corps ) appeared already in the early 1950s, when the North American F -86 Saberadapted to the role of
                an
                on-board
                machine. Airplanes designed in accordance with the requirements of all potential users could
                significantly
                contribute to
                reducing the costs of their construction. Unfortunately, often mutually exclusive requirements meant
                that
                there were
                practically no combat machines used by all types of armed forces. The exception is the McDonnell Douglas
                F-4
                Phantom II
                , although it was originally commissioned by the Navy.

                On February 23, 1993, the Department of Defense began the so-called Bottom-Up Review (BUR), an analysis
                of
                the
                adaptation of the armed forces to operations according to the new defense doctrine in force in the
                political
                and
                military situation changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In September 1993, the conclusions of
                the
                BUR
                analysis were announced. One of them was the need for maximum unification of the equipment of the armed
                forces
                (including aviation). This solution was to reduce the cost of developing and building new structures and
                reducing the
                unit price. On the basis of the BUR analysis in September 1993, the MRF and A / FX programs were
                canceled,
                and in their
                place the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST - Joint Advanced Strike Technology) program was
                established
                [4]. The
                JAST program formally began on January 27, 1994. Its goal was not so much to develop a ready-made
                aircraft
                for the US
                Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps, new weapons and avionics, but to test in practice the technology
                and
                design
                solutions for the new machine, which was planned to fly in around 1997, and to enter service in the
                final
                version,
                resulting from the work of the JAST program, for 2010. An equally important goal was to reduce the costs
                of
                developing
                and implementing new technologies into production. As a result, JAST was to end with the construction of
                the
                CTOL
                machine, which would complement the F-22 in the Air Force and replace the F-16 and A-10, as well as
                STOVL
                machines.for
                the US Marine Corps and Royal Navy, as successors to the Harriers and the F / A-18A-D, and the aircraft
                with
                conventional take-off and landing characteristics for US Navy aircraft carriers that would replace the F
                /
                A-18E / F. On
                September 2, 1994, the Department of Defense announced a call for Request for Proposal . On December 22
                of
                the same
                year, the list of twenty-four companies with which initial contacts were signed as part of the phase
                known
                as Concept
                Definition and Design Research [4] [5] was announced. The contractors included Boeing Defense and Space
                Group, McDonnell
                Douglas Aerospace, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Corporation, among others. In total, contracts were
                awarded
                for the
                order of $ 140 billion. The main differences between the designs concerned the choice of drive
                configuration
                for the
                STVOL version. Boeing proposed the most classic solution originally known as the Configuration AVX-70,
                very
                similar to
                Harrier's design: an engine with additional moving nozzles that deflect to change the thrust vector.
                Northrop Grumman
                proposed a solution known from the Soviet Yak -141 and Yak-36 planes: at the end of the marching engine
                there is a
                movable nozzle tilted downwards and an additional vertical take-off and landing supporting engine,
                placed
                vertically
                behind the pilot's cabin. The most innovative solution was proposed by Lockheed and McDonnell.
                Lockheed's
                design known
                as Configuration 100 proposed placing a pilot shaft fan directly behind the cockpit that supplies power
                from
                the main
                engine. A similar solution was adopted by McDonnell in his proposal known as Configuration 1, but in his
                design the
                turbine located behind the cabin was to be powered by gases discharged from the main engine.

                In 1983, DARPA (Agencja Advanced Defense Research Projects, then known as Advanced Research Projects
                Agency)
                started the
                Advanced Short Take-Off / Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) program. The program aimed to develop the technology
                needed to build
                a supersonic aircraft capable of replacing the AV-8B used by the United States Marine Corps and Harriery
                II
                of the Royal
                Air Force . In 1986, an agreement was signed to start cooperation between the Royal Aircraft
                Establishment
                (now Defense
                Evaluation and Research Agency) and DARPA [4] . In 1987, the program was handed over to Lockheed, which
                in
                its branch,
                unofficially known as Skunk Works, was developing with the help of NASA the construction of a supersonic
                fighter plane
                with STOVL properties . Lockheed proposed the creation of a joint combat platform with STOVL properties
                for
                the US
                Marine Corps, US Navy and US Air Force as part of the STOVL Strike Fighter (SSF) program. In addition to
                the
                features of
                shortened take-off and landing, the new plane would also have stealth properties. In 1993, the SSF
                program
                changed its
                name to become the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) program. The new program was designed to
                create a common
                platform for the Royal Navy and the US Marine Corps and a light fighter for the US Air Force. In 1994,
                the
                name of the
                program was changed again to Affordable Lightweight Fighter (ALF) [4] .
            </p>

                X-35A during testing at Edwards Base
                In October 1995, the American Congress decided to merge the JAST and CALF programs. In June 1996, the
                combined program
                was renamed the Joint Strike Fighter [4] . In March 1996, the final requirements to be met by the new
                aircraft were set
                out with the announcement of another Request for Proposal [4] . At the beginning of the program, the
                demand
                for a new
                plane was estimated at 3002 units. 1763 of which were intended for the US Air Force to replace the A-10
                and
                F-16.
                Another 480 intended for the US Navy would replace the F / A-18C / D machines. 609 aircraft would be
                purchased by the
                Marines, withdrawing their AV-8B and F / A-18. 150 machines would enter service with the Royal Navy
                withdrawing its
                Harriers [6]. The entire program has been divided into two preliminary phases. The first of them, known
                as
                the Concept
                Demonstration Program (CDP), was to end with the construction of a flying demonstrator used in the
                project
                and the
                future serial aircraft of technologies and design solutions. The second phase, known as the Preferred
                Weapon
                System
                Concept (PWSC - the preferred configuration of the combat version), was aimed at presenting the
                configuration of the
                on-board equipment used in the design, including the navigation and targeting system. On November 16,
                1996,
                the
                Department of Defense announced that two companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, had been selected for
                the
                CDP phase [6]
                [7] . On May 28, 2002, an agreement on joining the research and development phase ( system design and
                development- SDD)
                of the JSF program was signed by Denmark with the US government, and on June 5 by the Netherlands [8] .

            <p class="paragraph">
                <span>JSF partners </span>
                The main partners of the Joint Strike Fighter program , which accounted for the majority of the design
                R&D
                expenditure,
                are the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, by 2006, eight more countries had decided to
                jointly finance
                the project and would likely purchase a new machine in the future. The total cost of the development of
                the
                structure
                was estimated at over USD 55 billion , of which over 90% are American funds. Its cost increased from $
                34
                billion in
                2001, $ 40 billion in 2004 [15] , $ 44 billion in 2008 [16] to $ 55.13 billion in 2015 RDT & E
                (research,
                development,
                testing and evaluation), including 12 billion for development the F135 engine [17] .

            <h1>F34A</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" id="F35A">
                The smallest and lightest version of Lightning intended for the USAF, where it is to replace the F-16
                Fighting Falcon
                and A-10 Thunderbolty II. The only version equipped with a 25mm fixed cannon , more powerful than those
                used
                so far by
                the US Air Force since the introduction of the 20mm Vulcan cannons on the F-4E Phantom . On February 25,
                2011, the first
                serial F-35A, designated AF-6, intended for the US Air Force, took off from the Naval Air Station Fort
                Worth
                Joint
                Reserve Base airport [50]. Lockheed test pilot Bill Gigiotti was at the controls of the plane that took
                off
                at 3:05
                local time, after an hour's flight, the plane landed safely at 4:06 pm. The AF-6 was the seventeenth
                copy
                produced since
                2006. The aircraft had the markings of the 58th Fighter Squadron from the 33rd Wing ( 33d Fighter Wing )
                stationed at
                Eglin Air Force Base [51] .

                Norway equipped its planes with a braking parachute , not provided for in the project , for the use of
                icy
                belts [52] .
                Integration and tests of the parachute began in 2017 [53] , and Norwegian aircraft from the 8th LRIP
                series
                will be
                equipped with it [54] . Dutch planes are also to receive parachutes [55] . Canada, in addition to the
                parachute, is
                interested in equipping its F-35A (CF-35) with an in-flight refueling probe, an installation used on its
                CF-18 and
                available only on the F-35B / C [56]. Lockheed, anticipating that many potential foreign customers would
                be
                interested
                in the F-35A with the possibility of refueling with a flexible hose, left space in the hull for the
                integration of this
                installation (duplicating the fuel receiver used in the F-35A in accordance with the USAF requirements)

            <h1>F-35B</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" id="F35B">
                The STOVL short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, which is to replace the previously used
                Harriers,
                becomes the
                first serial supersonic machine with STOVL capabilities. The Marines plan to replace both Harriers and F
                /
                A-18 Hornet
                fighters with a machine similar to the F-35A, which will have larger fuel tanks at the expense of
                vertical
                flight
                systems. As in the Harriers, the firearms will be carried in a centrally mounted overhead bunker. So
                far,
                vertical
                flight is the most dangerous phase of flight and the development of appropriate safety systems and
                reliable
                mechanisms
                has a significant impact on the development of the machine.

                Instead of Harry's rotating main engine nozzles and additional maneuvering nozzles, the F-35B uses an
                innovative
                Lockheed Martin patented and Rolls-Royce shaft-driven fan technology. This solution consists in
                installing
                in the middle
                of the fuselage a horizontally located two-rotor counter-rotating fan driven by a clutch and gearfrom
                the
                main engine of
                the machine. The fan is responsible for the vertical movement of the machine, while the discharge of
                exhaust
                gases from
                the main nozzle, through special bypasses, to the controlled nozzles on the wings and sides of the
                fuselage,
                causes the
                plane to rotate. As a result, the F-35B engine drives two turbines, a carrier and a propulsion turbine,
                which perform
                the same tasks as a large Harrier turbine, but also allow flight at supersonic speeds. The presence of
                the
                fan results
                in a 30% lower fuel reserve, 35 cm shorter armament chambers, and the cockpit fairing is smaller
                compared to
                other
                versions.

                Two prototype machines were built for flight tests: the X-35A, which was later rebuilt to the X-35B
                version,
                and the
                X-35C equipped with larger wings.

                The X-35B first took off vertically on June 24, 2001. Simon Hargeaves, BAE Systems test pilot was at the
                controls of the
                machine. The machine rose to a height of 7.5 m and remained hovering for about 35 seconds and then
                landed
                vertically
                [58] .

            <p class="paragraph" id="F35C">
                F-35A version for the Israeli Air Force with Israeli weapons and additional systems. It was given the
                local
                name of Adir
                [60] .

                The first batch of 19-20 units to be delivered from 2016 is to differ from USAF planes only with the
                installation of the
                Israeli communication and data exchange system (C4I). Access to the source code of the fighter software,
                necessary for
                integration or modernization, which is also sought by Turkey and the United Kingdom, remains unclear
                [61] .
                The planes
                are to carry, inter alia, the guided bombs of the Rafael Spike series [62] . Israel operates the F-16I
                variant, which
                uses avionics elements produced by Israeli companies IAI , Elbit (Elop), Rafael , Elisra, Elta and
                Astronautics, i.e.
                HUD, computer, radio, data link, electronic warfare system, self-defense systems or self -alien
                identification system
                [63] .

                The first flight of the first F-35I took place on July 25, 2016 in Fort Worth [64] . By the end of 2016,
                Israel had
                ordered a total of fifty Adirs in three tranches [65]

                In May 2018, the use of the F-35I for the first time in combat was announced [66] . The air force
                commander,
                General
                Amikam Norkin, specified that the F-35s took part in two actions. In addition, he showed a photo of the
                Israeli F-35
                that was flying over Beirut.
