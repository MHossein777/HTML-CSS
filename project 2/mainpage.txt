            <h1>F34A</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" id="F35A">
                The smallest and lightest version of Lightning intended for the USAF, where it is to replace the F-16
                Fighting Falcon
                and A-10 Thunderbolty II. The only version equipped with a 25mm fixed cannon , more powerful than those
                used
                so far by
                the US Air Force since the introduction of the 20mm Vulcan cannons on the F-4E Phantom . On February 25,
                2011, the first
                serial F-35A, designated AF-6, intended for the US Air Force, took off from the Naval Air Station Fort
                Worth
                Joint
                Reserve Base airport [50]. Lockheed test pilot Bill Gigiotti was at the controls of the plane that took
                off
                at 3:05
                local time, after an hour's flight, the plane landed safely at 4:06 pm. The AF-6 was the seventeenth
                copy
                produced since
                2006. The aircraft had the markings of the 58th Fighter Squadron from the 33rd Wing ( 33d Fighter Wing )
                stationed at
                Eglin Air Force Base [51] .

                Norway equipped its planes with a braking parachute , not provided for in the project , for the use of
                icy
                belts [52] .
                Integration and tests of the parachute began in 2017 [53] , and Norwegian aircraft from the 8th LRIP
                series
                will be
                equipped with it [54] . Dutch planes are also to receive parachutes [55] . Canada, in addition to the
                parachute, is
                interested in equipping its F-35A (CF-35) with an in-flight refueling probe, an installation used on its
                CF-18 and
                available only on the F-35B / C [56]. Lockheed, anticipating that many potential foreign customers would
                be
                interested
                in the F-35A with the possibility of refueling with a flexible hose, left space in the hull for the
                integration of this
                installation (duplicating the fuel receiver used in the F-35A in accordance with the USAF requirements)

            <h1>F-35B</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" id="F35B">
                The STOVL short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, which is to replace the previously used
                Harriers,
                becomes the
                first serial supersonic machine with STOVL capabilities. The Marines plan to replace both Harriers and F
                /
                A-18 Hornet
                fighters with a machine similar to the F-35A, which will have larger fuel tanks at the expense of
                vertical
                flight
                systems. As in the Harriers, the firearms will be carried in a centrally mounted overhead bunker. So
                far,
                vertical
                flight is the most dangerous phase of flight and the development of appropriate safety systems and
                reliable
                mechanisms
                has a significant impact on the development of the machine.

                Instead of Harry's rotating main engine nozzles and additional maneuvering nozzles, the F-35B uses an
                innovative
                Lockheed Martin patented and Rolls-Royce shaft-driven fan technology. This solution consists in
                installing
                in the middle
                of the fuselage a horizontally located two-rotor counter-rotating fan driven by a clutch and gearfrom
                the
                main engine of
                the machine. The fan is responsible for the vertical movement of the machine, while the discharge of
                exhaust
                gases from
                the main nozzle, through special bypasses, to the controlled nozzles on the wings and sides of the
                fuselage,
                causes the
                plane to rotate. As a result, the F-35B engine drives two turbines, a carrier and a propulsion turbine,
                which perform
                the same tasks as a large Harrier turbine, but also allow flight at supersonic speeds. The presence of
                the
                fan results
                in a 30% lower fuel reserve, 35 cm shorter armament chambers, and the cockpit fairing is smaller
                compared to
                other
                versions.

                Two prototype machines were built for flight tests: the X-35A, which was later rebuilt to the X-35B
                version,
                and the
                X-35C equipped with larger wings.

                The X-35B first took off vertically on June 24, 2001. Simon Hargeaves, BAE Systems test pilot was at the
                controls of the
                machine. The machine rose to a height of 7.5 m and remained hovering for about 35 seconds and then
                landed
                vertically
                [58] .

            <p class="paragraph" id="F35C">
                F-35A version for the Israeli Air Force with Israeli weapons and additional systems. It was given the
                local
                name of Adir
                [60] .

                The first batch of 19-20 units to be delivered from 2016 is to differ from USAF planes only with the
                installation of the
                Israeli communication and data exchange system (C4I). Access to the source code of the fighter software,
                necessary for
                integration or modernization, which is also sought by Turkey and the United Kingdom, remains unclear
                [61] .
                The planes
                are to carry, inter alia, the guided bombs of the Rafael Spike series [62] . Israel operates the F-16I
                variant, which
                uses avionics elements produced by Israeli companies IAI , Elbit (Elop), Rafael , Elisra, Elta and
                Astronautics, i.e.
                HUD, computer, radio, data link, electronic warfare system, self-defense systems or self -alien
                identification system
